## ❓ Problem Statement  

### **What problem does this project solve?**  
This project was inspired by a personal experience—Spotify randomly recommended a playlist that was completely different from my usual K-pop and rap mix. It felt refreshing to revisit old songs and discover new ones.  

MusicMe aims to bring this experience to **anyone who enjoys music** and wants to **discover new genres or revisit forgotten tracks** effortlessly.
